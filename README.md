<h1> <b> This is a motherfucking website </h1> </b>
	<p> And it's fucking perfect </p>
	<h2><b>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want? </h2></b>
	<p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website: </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
          <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
          <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
          <li>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
          <li>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
	</ul>
