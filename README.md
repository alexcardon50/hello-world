<head> <b> This is a motherfucking website </head> </b>
	<p> And it's fucking perfect </p>
	<head><b>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want? </head></b>
	<p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe your perfect-ass website: <br />
    . Shit's lightweight and loads fast <br />
    . Fits on all your shitty screens <br />
    . Looks the same in all your shitty browsers <br />
    . The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits your site <br />
    . Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee) <br />
